# Responsible Research Practices Self-Assessment 

This is an interactive guide for the self-assessment of bias and the transparent reporting of a predictive model study.

The purpose of this guide is two-fold:

- To provide project teams with a means for reflecting upon the steps taken within the team to mitigate the effects of social, statistical, and cognitive biases throughout the project lifecycle, and
- To report and communicate these methods in a systematic, transparent, and accessible manner.

The guide is split into two sections that address the above goals: a [bias self-assessment](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rrp-selfassessment/bias/bias-intro.html) and a [transparent reporting reflect-list](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rrp-selfassessment/transparent-reporting/transparent-reporting.html). These two sections are interconnected through reference to a common project workflow.

The guide has been developed using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/). The benefit of this format is that it supports the integration of interactive elements that are designed to facilitate discussion within and between the teams.
