## 21 Supplementary Information

```{admonition} Description
Provide information about the availability of supplementary resources, such as study protocol, Web calculator, and data sets.
```

```{tabbed} Scientific Rationale
- A study protocol is an important component of prediction model research and development, which provides details such as a clear research aim, study design, description of predictors and outcome, and a statistical analysis plan. Including this protocol can allow readers to compare what was planned with what was actually performed or achieved.
- Additional tools or applications that are necessary to make individual predictions (e.g. web calculator) should be made accessible and details provided on where to access them.
- Where privacy concerns do not prevent sharing, datasets and code allow subsequent research to reproduce or replicate findings.
```

```{tabbed} Ethical Rationale
- Providing supplementary information can enhance the sustainability of the study by supporting open research efforts (e.g. responsible data sharing, open source software, open hardware, open access, open notebooks).

## 22 Funding

```{admonition} Description
Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study.
```

```{tabbed} Scientific Rationale
- Disclosure of funding is an important part of transparency, as it allows readers to independently judge whether there is a risk of bias in the study's findings. It is also important to disclose when no funding was received.
```

```{tabbed} Ethical Rationale
- In addition to identifying and evaluating a possible risk of bias in industry funded studies, disclosure of funding can also help funders identify over- or under-funded areas, which may contribute to systemic inequities in health research (e.g. lack of funding for diseases that disproportionately affect vulnerable or marginalised groups).
