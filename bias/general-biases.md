# General Biases

(bias:historical)=
## Historical Bias

```{admonition} Definition
:class: dropdown
Historical biases exist prior to the inception of any data science
project. However, they arise within the context of a project when there
is a gap or misalignment between the state of the world and the goals or
objectives that are encoded and propagated in the model or system being
developed. For instance, even with perfect sampling and feature
selection, a model that perpetuates (or exacerbates) socioeconomic
inequalities through the outcomes it promotes is contributing to
historical bias.

:class: tip
- *Which groups and communities will be affected by the use of your model?*
- *Are there groups or communities that will be excluded from your model? If so, why?*
- *Is there a risk of worsening or perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities in the development and deployment of your model?*
```

(bias:confirmation)=
## Confirmation Bias

```{admonition} Definition
:class: dropdown
A tendency to search for, gather, or use information that confirms
pre-existing ideas and beliefs, and to dismiss or downplay the
significance of information that disconfirms one's favoured hypothesis.
This can be the result of motivated reasoning or sub-conscious
attitudes, which in turn may lead to prejudicial judgements that are not
based on reasoned evidence.

- *What mechanisms do you have in place within your team that can help ensure a diversity of viewpoints that may mitigate the effects of confirmation bias?*
