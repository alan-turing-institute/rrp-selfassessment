  abstract = {With the passage of recent federal legislation many medical institutions are now responsible for reaching target hospital readmission rates. Chronic diseases account for many hospital readmissions and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease has been recently added to the list of diseases for which the United States government penalizes hospitals incurring excessive readmissions. Though there have been efforts to statistically predict those most in danger of readmission, few have focused primarily on unstructured clinical notes. We have proposed a framework which uses Natural Language Processing to analyze clinical notes and predict readmission. Many algorithms within the field of data mining and machine learning exist, so a framework for component selection is created to select the best components. Na\"ive Bayes using Chi-Squared feature selection offers an AUC of 0.690 while maintaining fast computational times.},

  abstract = {Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI). Results In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4\%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2\% (95\% CI, 1\%\textendash 3\%) and 9\% (95\% CI, 4\%\textendash 14\%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63\%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4\% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95\% CI, 1.4\textendash 2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60\%). Our results showed that 22\% (31/139) of current smokers and 46\% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5\%. Conclusion Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.},

  abstract = {Frequent COPD exacerbations have a large impact on morbidity, mortality and health-care expenditures. By 2020, the World Health Organization expects COPD and COPD exacerbations to be the third leading cause of death world-wide. Furthermore, In 2005 it was estimated that COPD exacerbations cost the U.S. health-care system 38 billion dollars. Studies attempting to determine factors related to COPD readmissions are still very limited. Moreover, few have used a organized machine-learning, sensitivity analysis approach, such as a Random Forest (RF) statistical model, to analyze this problem. This study utilized the RF machine learning algorithm to determine factors that predict risk for multiple COPD exacerbations in a single year.This was a retrospective study with a data set of 106 patients. These patients were divided randomly into training (80\%) and validating (20\%) data-sets, 100 times, using approximately sixty variables intially, which in prior studies had been found to be associated with patient readmission for COPD exacerbation. In an interactive manner, an RF model was created using the training set and validated on the testing dataset. Mean area-under-curve (AUC) statistics, sensitivity, specificity, and negative/positive predictive values (NPV, PPV) were calculated for the 100 runs.The following variables were found to be important predictors of patients having at least two COPD exacerbations within one year: employment, body mass index, number of previous surgeries, administration of azithromycin/ceftriaxone/moxifloxacin, and admission albumin level. The mean AUC was 0.72, sensitivity of 0.75, specificity of 0.56, PPV of 0.7 and NPV of 0.63. Histograms were used to confirm consistent accuracyThe RF design has consistently demonstrated encouraging results. We expect to validate our results on new patient groups and improve accuracy by increasing our training dataset. We hope that identifying patients at risk for frequent readmissions will improve patient outcome and save valuable hospital resources.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide because no effective treatment is currently available. Remdesivir has shown in vitro activity against coronaviruses and is a possible antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection., This prospective (compassionate), open-label study of remdesivir, which was conducted at Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, between February 23 and March 20, 2020, involved patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia aged {$\geq$}18 years undergoing mechanical ventilation or with an oxygen saturation level of {$\leq$}94 \% in air or a National Early Warning Score 2 of {$\geq$}4. The primary outcome was the change in clinical status based on a 7-category ordinal scale (1 = not hospitalised, resuming normal daily activities; 7 = deceased)., The 35 patients enrolled from February 23 to March 20, 2020, included 18 in intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 in our infectious diseases ward (IDW). The 10-day course of remdesivir was completed by 22 patients (63 \%) and discontinued by 13, of whom eight (22.8 \%) discontinued because of adverse events. The median follow-up was 39 days (IQR 25\textendash 44). At day 28, 14 (82.3 \%) patients from IDW were discharged, two were still hospitalized and one died (5.9 \%), whereas in ICU 6 (33.3 \%) were discharged, 8 (44.4 \%) patients died, three (16.7 \%) were still mechanically ventilated and one (5.6 \%) was improved but still hospitalized. Hypertransaminasemia and acute kidney injury were the most frequent severe adverse events observed (42.8 \% and 22.8 \% of the cases, respectively)., Our data suggest that remdesivir can benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalised outside ICU where clinical outcome was better and adverse events are less frequently observed. Ongoing randomised controlled trials will clarify its real efficacy and safety, who to treat, and when.},

  abstract = {Objectives Early warning scores were developed to improve recognition of clinical deterioration in acute hospital settings. In England, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is increasingly being recommended at a national level for use outside such settings. In 2015, the West of England Academic Health Science Network supported the roll-out of NEWS across a range of non-acute-hospital healthcare sectors. Research on the use of NEWS outside acute hospitals is limited. The objective of this study was to explore staff experiences of using NEWS in these new settings. Design Thematic analysis of qualitative semi-structured interviews with purposefully sampled healthcare staff. Setting West of England healthcare settings where NEWS was being used outside acute hospitals\textemdash primary care, ambulance, referral management, community and mental health services. Participants Twenty-five healthcare staff interviewed from primary care (9), ambulance (3), referral management/acute interface (5), community (4) and mental health services (3), and service commissioning (1). Results Participants reported that NEWS could support clinical decision-making around escalation of care, and provide a clear means of communicating clinical acuity between clinicians and across different healthcare organisations. Challenges with implementing NEWS varied\textemdash in primary care, clinicians had to select patients for NEWS and adopt different methods of clinical assessment, whereas for paramedics it fitted well with usual clinical practice and was used for all patients. In community services and mental health, modifications were `needed' to make the tool relevant to some patient populations. Conclusions This study demonstrated that while NEWS can work for staff outside acute hospital settings, the potential for routine clinical practice to accommodate NEWS in such settings varied. A tailored approach to implementation in different settings, incorporating guidance supported by further research on the use of NEWS with specific patient groups in community settings, may be beneficial, and enhance staff confidence in the tool.},

  abstract = {Recognising signs of deteriorating health in patients and responding to them appropriately are crucial nursing competencies. In acute care, failure to detect and act promptly on deterioration can lead to the patient's death. To achieve clinical competence, nursing students require training in the use of techniques for monitoring physiological observations as well as protocols that enable them to respond to deterioration. The use of early warning scores has been advocated to standardise the methods and frequency of patient monitoring in acute care settings. In 2012, the Royal College of Physicians developed the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), which was updated in 2017 and known as NEWS2. This early warning score is used in acute hospitals in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This article explores the benefits and challenges of using NEWS2 as an educational tool in pre-registration nursing programmes to support nursing students in recognising and responding to deteriorating health.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Objectives: To evaluate the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), currently recommended in the UK for risk-stratification of severe COVID-19 outcomes, and subsequently identify and validate a minimal set of common parameters taken at hospital admission that improve the score. Design: Retrospective observational cohort with internal and multi-hospital external validation. Setting: Secondary care. Interventions: Not applicable. Participants: Training and temporal external validation cohorts comprised 1464 patients admitted to King9s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (KCH) with COVID-19 disease from 1st March to 30th April 2020. External validation cohorts included 3869 patients from two UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas9 Hospitals, GSTT and University Hospitals Southampton, UHS) and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was patient status at 14 days after symptom onset categorised as severe disease (transferred to intensive care unit or death). Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) were included. Results: NEWS2 score on admission was a weak predictor of severe COVID-19 infection (AUC = 0.628). Adding age and common blood tests (CRP, neutrophil count, estimated GFR and albumin) provided substantial improvements to a risk stratification model, particularly in relation to sensitivity, but performance was only moderate (AUC = 0.753). Improvement over NEWS2 remained robust and generalisable in GSTT (AUC = 0.817), UHS (AUC = 0.835) and Wuhan hospitals (AUC = 0.918). Conclusions: Adding age and a minimal set of blood parameters to NEWS2 improves the detection of patients likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes. This finding was replicated across NHS and non-UK hospitals. Adding a few common parameters to a pre-existing acuity score allows rapid and easy implementation of this risk-scoring system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is currently recommended in the United Kingdom for risk stratification of COVID outcomes, but little is known about its ability to detect severe cases. We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for severe COVID outcome and identify and validate a set of routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters taken at hospital admission to improve the score. Methods: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1st March to 30th April 2020. External validation cohorts included 5037 patients from four UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID disease (transfer to intensive care unit or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures,  blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. Results: A baseline model of 'NEWS2 + age' had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID infection at 14 days (AUC in training sample = 0.700; 95\% CI: 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192; 95\% CI: 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, CRP, estimated GFR, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95\% CI: 0.715, 0.757) and these improvements were replicated across five UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. Conclusions: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease commonly encountered in the primary care. This study aimed to audit COPD care at 13 public primary care clinics of Hong Kong and to work out improvement strategies. Method: All COPD patients who were aged 40 or above and had been followed up at 13 public primary care clinics of Kowloon Central Cluster (KCC), Hong Kong were included in this clinic audit. Evidence-based audit criteria and performance standards were established after thorough literature review. Phase 1 was from 01/04/2016 to 31/032017, with de ciencies identi ed, followed by one-year implementation phase with improvement strategies being executed. Phase 2 was from 01/04/2018 to 31/03/2019 with outcome of enhancement reviewed. Chi-square test and student's t test were used to compare the signi cance of relevant changes noted. Results: 2,358 COPD cases were identi ed in phase 1. Among the 658 smokers, 332 (50.5\%) had been referred to Smoking Counselling and Cessation and Service (SCCS) and 289 (43.9\%) actually attended it. 991 cases (42\%) received Seasonal In uenza Vaccine (SIV) and 938 (39.8\%) received Pneumococcal Vaccine (PCV). 698 (29.6\%) patients had spirometry done before and 423 cases (17.9\%) had been admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). With the concerted effort taken during the implementation phase, phase 2 data showed signi cance improvement in almost all criteria. There was a marked improvement in SIV and PCV coverage, spirometry performance rate and most important of all, a reduction in the AECOPD (n=294, 13.5\%, P=0.000043). However, the SCCS referral rate and attendance rate among smokers remained stagnant (both P{$>$}0.05). Conclusion: COPD care at primary care clinics of KCC has been tremendously improved in most of the audit criteria via a systematic team approach, therefore reducing the burden to specialist and hospital.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease where early detection benefits the survival rate. COPD can be quantified by classifying patches of computed tomography images, and combining patch labels into an overall diagnosis for the image. As labeled patches are often not available, image labels are propagated to the patches, incorrectly labeling healthy patches in COPD patients as being affected by the disease. We approach quantification of COPD from lung images as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, which is more suitable for such weakly labeled data. We investigate various MIL assumptions in the context of COPD and show that although a concept region with COPD-related disease patterns is present, considering the whole distribution of lung tissue patches improves the performance. The best method is based on averaging instances and obtains an AUC of 0.742, which is higher than the previously reported best of 0.713 on the same dataset. Using the full training set further increases performance to 0.776, which is significantly higher (DeLong test) than previous results.},

The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19\textendash associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.},

  abstract = {Summary. Background: An excessive anticoagulant effect because of coumarins is frequently encountered. Objective: To review available literature on the management of warfarin-associated coagulopathy and to propose evidence-based treatment algorithms. Methods: Data sources were Medline and Embase. Papers published between 1966 and December 2005 describing randomized trials or prospective cohort studies evaluating treatments for coumarin-associated coagulopathy were abstracted. Results: Low dose oral vitamin K rapidly and reliably returns the international normalized ratio (INR) to the usual therapeutic range in non-bleeding patients. Simple withholding of acenocumarol results in rapid correction of its anticoagulant effect. The impact of oral vitamin K on phenprocumon-associated coagulopathy cannot be determined from available literature. Intravenous vitamin K and coagulation factors should be given to patients with major or life-threatening hemorrhage. The optimal dose and type of coagulation factor is not known. Conclusions: Vitamin K therapy is an effective treatment for INR prolongation in patients with coumarin-associated coagulopathy; coagulation factor replacement is required, in addition, in patients with major bleeding or with indication for immediate correction of their INR. Clinical trials powered to detect differences in rates of bleeding and thrombosis are now required to determine if vitamin K reduces the risk of bleeding without causing thrombosis in non-bleeding patients with prolonged INR.},

Method: this is a methodological study. The process will be based on the model of Beaton and collaborators following six steps: initial translation, synthesis of translations, reverse translation, committee of experts, final version test and process audit. The final version will be tested in a university hospital in the South of Brazil, with a sample of 40 nurses, who will apply the scale to three case studies proposed by the researchers. Transcripts will be transcribed and analyzed using the Kappa coefficient and the agreement of the observers will be evaluated. A cohort study will be performed for the validation of the Nursing records of patients admitted to the emergency room in May 2018, and the outcomes of death or unscheduled transfer to intensive care in 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. The ethical aspects will be respected by the study, obtaining as an educational product the NEWS2 scale translated and adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. Expected results: we intend to translate, adapt and validate NEWS producing a valuable product for patient care.

Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis.  Results: The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study. According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37\% (95\%CI: 10.15\%-23.65\%), 12.11\% (95\%CI 4.40\%-22.75\%), 7.63\% (95\%CI 3.83\%-12.43\%) and 7.87\% (95\%CI 6.57\%-9.28\%), respectively.  Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively.},

  abstract = {Methodological contributions: This paper introduces a family of kernels for analyzing (anatomical) trees endowed with vector valued measurements made along the tree. While state-of-the-art graph and tree kernels use combinatorial tree/graph structure with discrete node and edge labels, the kernels presented in this paper can include geometric information such as branch shape, branch radius or other vector valued properties. In addition to being flexible in their ability to model different types of attributes, the presented kernels are computationally efficient and some of them can easily be computed for large datasets (N of the order 10.000) of trees with 30-600 branches. Combining the kernels with standard machine learning tools enables us to analyze the relation between disease and anatomical tree structure and geometry. Experimental results: The kernels are used to compare airway trees segmented from low-dose CT, endowed with branch shape descriptors and airway wall area percentage measurements made along the tree. Using kernelized hypothesis testing we show that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy individuals. The geometric tree kernels also give a significant increase in the classification accuracy of COPD from geometric tree structure endowed with airway wall thickness measurements in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, giving further insight into the relationship between airway wall thickness and COPD.

  abstract = {Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasingly considered a heterogeneous condition. It was hypothesised that COPD, as currently defined, includes different clinically relevant subtypes. Methods To identify and validate COPD subtypes, 342 subjects hospitalised for the first time because of a COPD exacerbation were recruited. Three months after discharge, when clinically stable, symptoms and quality of life, lung function, exercise capacity, nutritional status, biomarkers of systemic and bronchial inflammation, sputum microbiology, CT of the thorax and echocardiography were assessed. COPD groups were identified by partitioning cluster analysis and validated prospectively against cause-specific hospitalisations and all-cause mortality during a 4 year follow-up. Results Three COPD groups were identified: group 1 (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}126, 67 years) was characterised by severe airflow limitation (postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 38\% predicted) and worse performance in most of the respiratory domains of the disease; group 2 (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}125, 69 years) showed milder airflow limitation (FEV1 63\% predicted); and group 3 (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}91, 67 years) combined a similarly milder airflow limitation (FEV1 58\% predicted) with a high proportion of obesity, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and systemic inflammation. During follow-up, group 1 had more frequent hospitalisations due to COPD (HR 3.28, p{$<$}0.001) and higher all-cause mortality (HR 2.36, p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.018) than the other two groups, whereas group 3 had more admissions due to cardiovascular disease (HR 2.87, p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.014). Conclusions In patients with COPD recruited at their first hospitalisation, three different COPD subtypes were identified and prospectively validated: `severe respiratory COPD', `moderate respiratory COPD', and `systemic COPD'.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Quantitative computed tomography (qCT) is an emergent technique for diagnostics and research in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). qCT parameters demonstrate a correlation with pulmonary function tests and symptoms. However, qCT only provides anatomical, not functional, information. We evaluated five distinct, partial-machine learning-based mathematical models to predict lung function parameters from qCT values in comparison with pulmonary function tests. Methods: 75 patients with diagnosed COPD underwent body plethysmography and a dose-optimized qCT examination on a third-generation, dual-source CT with inspiration and expiration. Delta values (inspiration\textemdash expiration) were calculated afterwards. Four parameters were quantified: mean lung density, lung volume low-attenuated volume, and full width at half maximum. Five models were evaluated for best prediction: average prediction, median prediction, k-nearest neighbours (kNN), gradient boosting, and multilayer perceptron. Results: The lowest mean relative error (MRE) was calculated for the kNN model with 16\%. Similar low MREs were found for polynomial regression as well as gradient boosting-based prediction. Other models led to higher MREs and thereby worse predictive performance. Beyond the sole MRE, distinct differences in prediction performance, dependent on the initial dataset (expiration, inspiration, delta), were found. Conclusion: Different, partially machine learning-based models allow the prediction of lung function values from static qCT parameters within a reasonable margin of error. Therefore, qCT parameters may contain more information than we currently utilize and can potentially augment standard functional lung testing.},

Data sources Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Embase until June 2019. Eligibility criteria for study selection Studies describing the development or external validation of an early warning score for adult hospital inpatients. Results 13 171 references were screened and 95 articles were included in the review. 11 studies were development only, 23 were development and external validation, and 61 were external validation only. Most early warning scores were developed for use in the United States (n=13/34, 38\%) and the United Kingdom (n=10/34, 29\%). Death was the most frequent prediction outcome for development studies (n=10/23, 44\%) and validation studies (n=66/84, 79\%), with different time horizons (the most frequent was 24 hours). The most common predictors were respiratory rate (n=30/34, 88\%), heart rate (n=28/34, 83\%), oxygen saturation, temperature, and systolic blood pressure (all n=24/34, 71\%). Age (n=13/34, 38\%) and sex (n=3/34, 9\%) were less frequently included. Key details of the analysis populations were often not reported in development studies (n=12/29, 41\%) or validation studies (n=33/84, 39\%). Small sample sizes and insufficient numbers of event patients were common in model development and external validation studies. Missing data were often discarded, with just one study using multiple imputation. Only nine of the early warning scores that were developed were presented in sufficient detail to allow individualised risk prediction. Internal validation was carried out in 19 studies, but recommended approaches such as bootstrapping or cross validation were rarely used (n=4/19, 22\%). Model performance was frequently assessed using discrimination (development n=18/22, 82\%; validation n=69/84, 82\%), while calibration was seldom assessed (validation n=13/84, 15\%). All included studies were rated at high risk of bias. Conclusions Early warning scores are widely used prediction models that are often mandated in daily clinical practice to identify early clinical deterioration in hospital patients. However, many early warning scores in clinical use were found to have methodological weaknesses. Early warning scores might not perform as well as expected and therefore they could have a detrimental effect on patient care. Future work should focus on following recommended approaches for developing and evaluating early warning scores, and investigating the impact and safety of using these scores in clinical practice.

This novel strain is highly transmittable and severe disease has been reported in up to 16\% of hospitalized cases. More than 600,000 cases have been confirmed and the number of deaths is constantly increasing. COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially those suffering from severe respiratory or systemic manifestations, fall under the spectrum of the acutely ill medical population, which is at increased venous thromboembolism risk. Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients infected with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients' clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, we highlight the importance of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 infected patients and review relevant data of previous coronavirus epidemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).},

There has been a maelstrom of global research, with mixed consequences. Positives include the greater provision of open access to covid-19 studies, some increased collaboration, expedited governance and ethics approvals of new clinical studies, and wider use of preprints. But many problems have become evident. Before the pandemic, it was estimated that up to 85\% of research was wasted because of poor questions, poor study design, inefficiency of regulation and conduct, and non or poor reporting of results.1 Many of these problems are amplified in covid-19 research, with time pressures and inadequate research infrastructure contributing.An extraordinary number of covid-19 trials have been registered since the pandemic started. The National Library of Medicine registry ClinicalTrials.gov lists 1087 covid-19 studies, and though some will provide useful information, many are too small and poorly designed to be helpful, merely adding to the covid-19 noise.

  abstract = {Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide. Objective To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status. Methods We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results The mean age was 48.9 years and 686 (42.7\%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0\% of the study population. 131 (8.2\%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1\%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9\%), followed by diabetes (8.2\%). 130 (8.2\%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95\% CI) 2.681 (1.424\textendash 5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03\textendash 2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07\textendash 2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60\textendash 7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95\% CI) was 1.79 (1.16\textendash 2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61\textendash 4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. Conclusion Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the greatest medical challenge in decades. We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) \textemdash a homologue of ACE\textemdash to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin\textendash angiotensin\textendash aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.},

  abstract = {Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have difficulties with keeping their weight. The aim of this investigation was to study nutritional status in hospitalised Nordic COPD patients and to investigate the association between nutritional status and long-term mortality in this patient group. In a multicentre study conducted at four university hospitals (Reykjavik, Uppsala, Tampere and Copenhagen) hospitalised patients with COPD were investigated. Patient height, weight and lung function was recorded. Health status was assessed with St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire. After 2 years, mortality data was obtained from the national registers in each country. Of the 261 patients in the study 19\% where underweight (BMI {$<$}20), 41\% were of normal weight (BMI 20\textendash 25), 26\% were overweight (BMI 25\textendash 30) and 14\% were obese. FEV1 was lowest in the underweight and highest in the overweight group (p=0.001) whereas the prevalence of diabetes and cardio-vascular co-morbidity went the opposite direction. Of the 261 patients 49 (19\%) had died within 2 years. The lowest mortality was found among the overweight patients, whereas underweight was related to increased overall mortality. The association between underweight in COPD-patients, and mortality remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders such as FEV1 (hazard risk ratio (95\% CI) 2.6 (1.3\textendash 5.2)). We conclude that COPD patients that are underweight at admission to hospital have a higher risk of dying within the next 2 years. Further studies are needed in order to show whether identifying and treating weight loss and depletion of fat-free mass (FFM) is a way forward in improving the prognosis for hospitalised COPD patients.},

National data were obtained for mortality, emergency hospital admissions, general practitioner contacts and symptoms in the early 1990s. Age/sex patterns, seasonal variations and regional and urban/rural age/sex standardised event ratios were examined. Spearman rank correlations were used to describe consistency of regional rankings across data sets. Asthma showed inconsistent disease patterns in different data sources and weak correlations for regional rankings but COPD was notably consistent. Unmeasured confounders may partly explain the findings, but individual level adjustment for social class and smoking (possible for symptoms) only partially attenuated the higher COPD rates in northern and urban areas and did not affect findings for asthma. When epidemiological patterns are consistent across data sources as with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in England, healthcare use is likely to reflect the underlying prevalence and severity of disease and can be used to study environmental influences. When patterns vary, as with asthma, the validity of the data in relation to its intended use must be carefully considered.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assist clinicians and researchers in choosing outcome  measures for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease attending  routine outpatient clinics, a comparative assessment was undertaken of four  questionnaires designed to reflect the patients' perception of their  physical and emotional health in terms of their feasibility, validity,  reliability, and responsiveness to health change. METHODS: Two condition  specific questionnaires, the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)  and Guyatt's Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), and two generic  questionnaires, the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Euroqol (EQ),  were compared for their discriminative and evaluative properties.  Spirometric tests and a walking test were also performed. One hundred and  fifty six adults who were clinically judged to have COPD and who attended  an outpatient chest clinic were assessed at recruitment and six and 12  months later. Patients were also asked whether their health had changed  since their last assessment. RESULTS: Completion rates and consistency  between items for dimensions of the SGRQ were lower than for dimensions of  the other questionnaires. The distributions of responses were skewed for  certain dimensions in all questionnaires except the CRQ. Validity was  supported for all instruments insofar as patients' scores were associated  with differences in disease severity. The generic questionnaires better  reflected other health problems. All instruments were reliable over time.  The condition specific questionnaires were more responsive between baseline  and first follow up visit but this difference did not persist. While  certain dimensions of the SF-36 were responsive to patient perceived  changes, this did not apply to the derived single index of the EQ. The  rating scale of the EQ, however, provided a quick and easy indicator of  change. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this study supports the CRQ and the  SF-36 as comprehensive outcome measures for patients with longstanding  COPD.},

We aimed to create predictive models for coagulopathy progression using machine-learning techniques to evaluate predictive accuracies of machine-learning and conventional techniques. A post-hoc subgroup analysis was conducted based on the Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation retrospective study. We used the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score to calculate the {$\Delta$}DIC score as ((DIC score on Day 3) - (DIC score on Day 1)). The primary outcome was to determine whether the predictive accuracy of {$\Delta$}DIC was more than 0. The secondary outcome was the actual predictive accuracy of {$\Delta$}DIC (predicted {$\Delta$}DIC-real {$\Delta$}DIC). We used the machine-learning methods, such as random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks (NN); their predictive accuracies were compared with those of conventional methods. In total, 1017 patients were included. Regarding DIC progression, predictive accuracy of the multiple linear regression, RF, SVM, and NN models was 63.7\%, 67.0\%, 64.4\%, and 59.8\%, respectively. The difference between predicted {$\Delta$}DIC and real {$\Delta$}DIC was 2.05, 1.54, 2.24, and 1.77 for the multiple linear regression, RF, SVM, and NN models, respectively. RF had the highest predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is presenting the health system with new challenges, and there is a great need for knowledge about symptoms, clinical findings and course of illness in patients admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (B\ae rum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak. We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. RESULTS: In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42~patients, of whom 28 (67~\%) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95). Fever (79~\%), reduced general condition (79~\%), dyspnoea (69~\%) and cough (67~\%) were the most common symptoms. A total of nine patients (21~\%) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital. Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3). Only one of the most severely ill patients scored {$\geq$} 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission. INTERPRETATION: Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms. A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness. A NEWS2 score of {$\geq$} 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score {$\geq$} 2~proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.},

  abstract = {Key Points  Question: Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States?    Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95\% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95\% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95\% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95\% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months.   Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities.    Abstract  Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US.   Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US.   Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19  deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months.  Exposure(s): COVID-19.  Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use.  Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95\% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95\% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95\% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95\% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6.     Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.},

  abstract = {Background: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) calculated from physiological observations provides a simple away to identify and respond to the deteriorating patient. There is increasing interest in the application of NEWS to facilitate referrals from the community. Aim: To establish whether elevated NEWS are associated with adverse outcomes at 5 and 30 days when obtained in a community setting at the time of transfer to an acute setting. Design \& setting: A retrospective service evaluation was undertaken using a database of emergency admissions to secondary care from two NHS district general hospitals within the South of England between January 2018 and April 2019. Method: The performance of NEWS recorded in a community setting to predict death or critical care admission at 5 and 30 days was calculated using established thresholds. Results: 2786 referrals from primary care were analysed. The 5 day and 30 day mortality was 2.2\% (1.7 to 2.8) and 7.1\% (6.2 to 8.1). The prevalence of the composite outcome was 3.4\% (2.8 to 4.2) at 5 days and 8.5\% (7.5 to 9.6) at 30 days. The risk of adverse outcomes increased incrementally with increasing NEWS. When calculated at the point of referral from primary care the positive predictive value of death at 5 and 30 days was 15\% (95\% confidence intervals [CI] = 12 to 19) and 23\% (95\% CI = 17 to 30) in the high-r\-isk NEWS group. Conclusion: Elevated NEWS obtained in the community during the process of emergency admission are associated with adverse outcomes. Communicating NEWS may allow downstream care to be better calibrated to risk.},

  abstract = {Hospitalizations for acute exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a great impact on health care expenditure. The aim of this study was to look at predictive factors of hospitalization for acute exacerbation in a group of patients with moderate to severe COPD. During the year 1994, we included 64 patients with COPD in this study. At inclusion, the patients being in a stable state, we performed a complete evaluation of their clinical, spirometric, gasometric, and pulmonary hemodynamic characteristics. All patients were followed during a period of at least 2.5 yr. We recorded the intervals free of hospitalization for exacerbation and realized an analysis of the proportional hazards not to be hospitalized using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis using the log-rank test showed that the risk of being hospitalized was significantly increased in patients with COPD with a low body mass index (BMI {$<$} 20 kg/m2 , p 5 0.015) and in patients with a limited 6-min walk distance ({$<$} 367 m, p 5 0.045). But above all, the risk of hospitalization for acute exacerbation was significantly increased by gas exchange impairment and pulmonary hemodynamic worsening: PaO2  {$<$} 65 mm Hg versus PaO2 . 65 mm Hg, p 5 0.005; PaCO2 . 44 mm Hg versus PaCO2 {$<$} 44 mm Hg, p 5 0.005; and mean pulmonary artery pressure ( ) at rest . 18 mm Hg versus {$<$} 18 mm Hg, p 5 0.0008. Neither age, nor the association of one or more comorbidities with COPD, nor the smoking habits had a significant impact on the risk of hospitalization in our study. Multivariate analysis showed that only PaCO2 and were independently related to the risk of hospitalization for acute exacerbation of COPD. We conclude that chronic hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension are predictive factors of hospitalization for acute exacerbation in COPD patients},

  abstract = {We introduce a Feasible Artificial Intelligence with Simple Trajectories for Predicting Adverse Catastrophic Events (FAST-PACE) solution for preparing immediate intervention in emergency situations. FAST-PACE utilizes a concise set of collected features to construct an artificial intelligence model that predicts the onset of cardiac arrest or acute respiratory failure from 1 h to 6 h prior to its occurrence. Data from the trajectory of 29,181 patients in intensive care units of two hospitals includes periodic vital signs, a history of treatment, current health status, and recent surgery. It excludes the results of laboratory data to construct a feasible application in wards, out-hospital emergency care, emergency transport, or other clinical situations where instant medical decisions are required with restricted patient data. These results are superior to previous warning scores including the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). The primary outcome was the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model predicting adverse events 1 h to 6 h prior to occurrence without lab data; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this model was 0.886 for cardiac arrest and 0.869 for respiratory failure 6 h before occurrence. The secondary outcome was the superior prediction performance to MEWS (net reclassification improvement of 0.507 for predicting cardiac arrest and 0.341 for predicting respiratory failure) and NEWS (net reclassification improvement of 0.412 for predicting cardiac arrest and 0.215 for predicting respiratory failure) 6 h before occurrence. This study suggests that AI consisting of simple vital signs and a brief interview could predict a cardiac arrest or acute respiratory failure 6 h earlier.},

The current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 has already resulted in high numbers of critically ill patients and deaths in the nonpregnant population, mainly due to respiratory failure. During viral outbreaks, pregnancy poses a uniquely increased risk to women due to changes to immune function, alongside physiological adaptive alterations, such as increased oxygen consumption and edema of the respiratory tract. The laboratory derangements may be reminiscent of HELLP syndrome, and thus knowledge of the COVID19 relationship is paramount for appropriate diagnosis and management. In addition to routine measurements of D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients presenting with COVID19 as per ISTH guidance, monitoring of APTT and fibrinogen levels should be considered in pregnancy, as highlighted in this report. These investigations in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID19 infection, and may warrant pre-emptive admission and consideration of delivery to achieve maternal stabilization.},

However, these changes, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a machine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9\% and specificity of 97.9\%. The cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis. We believe that our results present a significant contribution to improvements in COVID-19 diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: During the recent global urgency, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for a new technology to support in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic. Method: A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead. Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.},

Materials and methods This was a retrospective observational study and the electronic medical records of the patients were reviewed based on NEWS at the time of admission. Results The performance of NEWS was effective in predicting hospital mortality (area under the curve: 0.765; 95\% confidence interval: 0.659\textendash 0.846). Based on the Kaplan Meier survival curves, the survival time of patients who are at high risk according to NEWS was significantly shorter than that of patients who are at low risk (p {$<$} 0.001). Results of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the hazard ratios of patients who are at medium and high risk based on NEWS were 2.6 and 4.7, respectively (p {$<$} 0.001). In addition, our study showed that the combination model that used other factors, such as age and diagnosis, was more effective than NEWS alone in predicting hospital mortality (NEWS: 0.765; combination model: 0.861; p {$<$} 0.005). Conclusions NEWS is a simple and useful bedside tool for predicting in-hospital mortality. In addition, the rapid response team must consider other clinical factors as well as screening tools to improve clinical outcomes.},

The versatility of AI/ML technologies enables scientists and technologists to address an impressively broad range of biomedical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic challenges. This wide-reaching scientific capacity, however, also raises a diverse array of ethical challenges. The need for researchers to act quickly and globally in tackling SARS-CoV-2 demands unprecedented practices of open research and responsible data sharing at a time when innovation ecosystems are hobbled by proprietary protectionism, inequality, and a lack of public trust. Moreover, societally impactful interventions like digital contact tracing are raising fears of `surveillance creep' and are challenging widely held commitments to privacy, autonomy, and civil liberties. Prepandemic concerns that data-driven innovations may function to reinforce entrenched dynamics of societal inequity have likewise intensified given the disparate impact of the virus on vulnerable social groups and the life-and-death consequences of biased and discriminatory public health outcomes. To address these concerns, I offer five steps that need to be taken to encourage responsible research and innovation. These provide a practice-based path to responsible AI/ML design and discovery centered on open, accountable, equitable, and democratically governed processes and products. When taken from the start, these steps will not only enhance the capacity of innovators to tackle COVID-19 responsibly, they will, more broadly, help to better equip the data science and AI/ML community to cope with future pandemics and to support a more humane, rational, and just society.},

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is an infectious acute respiratory caused by the novel coronavirus. The virus is a positive-strand RNA virus with high homology to bat coronavirus. In this study, conserved domain analysis, homology modeling, and molecular docking were used to compare the biological roles of specific proteins of the novel coronavirus. The results showed that some viral structural and nonstructural proteins could bind to the porphyrin, respectively. At the same time, orf1ab, ORF10 and ORF3a proteins coordinated to attack heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin, dissociating iron to form porphyrin. Deoxyhemoglobin is more vulnerable to virus attacks than oxidized hemoglobin. The attack will cause less and less hemoglobin that can carry oxygen and carbon dioxide, producing symptoms of respiratory distress. Virus attack damaged many organs and tissues. Lung cells are toxic and inflammatory due to derivatives produced by the attack, which eventually resulted in ground-glass-like lung images. Capillaries easily broken due to inflammation. Proteins such as fibrinogen filled the capillaries' cracks through the coagulation reaction. Therefore, many fibrin and thrombus gathered in the lung tissue of critically ill patients. The mechanism also interfered with the normal heme anabolic pathway of the human body, expecting to result in human disease. This paper is only for academic discussion, the correctness of the theory needs to be confirmed by other experiments. According to the reader's suggestion, the content of the drug-related efficacy analysis has been deleted. Due to the side effects of drugs, please consult a qualified doctor for detailed treatment information, and do not take the drug yourself. We look forward to these discoveries bringing more ideas to people and inspiring people's confidence in defeating the virus.},

Effective early prediction of vital signs help to alert medical practitioner ahead of time and may prevent adverse health outcomes. In this paper, we suggest a new approach called generative boosting, in order to effectively perform early prediction of vital signs. Generative boosting consists of a generative model, to generate synthetic data for next few time steps, and several predictive models, to directly make long-range predictions based on observed and generated data. We explore generative boosting via long short-term memory (LSTM) for both the predictive and generative models, leading to a scheme called generative LSTM (GLSTM). Our experiments indicate that GLSTM outperforms a diverse range of strong benchmark models, with and without generative boosting. Finally, we use a mutual information based clustering algorithm to select a more representative dataset to train the generative model of GLSTM. This significantly improves the long-range predictive performance of high variation vital signs such as heart rate and systolic blood pressure.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of the study is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate in hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is safe and will accelerate the virological clearance rate for patients with moderately severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) when compared to standard care. Furthermore, we hypothesize that early treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate is associated with more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms as assessed by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), decreased admission rate to intensive care units and mortality, and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide). TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomised controlled group sequential adaptive trial designed to assess the effect on viral loads and clinical outcome of hydroxychloroquine sulphate therapy in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone in patients with established Covid-19. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), this pragmatic trial can include a larger number of patients over a short period of time and at a lower cost than studies utilizing traditional randomized controlled trial designs with an external study organization. The pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomisation and allocation to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients will be recruited from all inpatients at Akershus University Hospital, L\o renskog, Norway. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. All of the following conditions must apply to the prospective patient at screening prior to inclusion: (1) Hospitalisation; (2) Adults 18 years or older; (3) Moderately severe Covid-19 disease (NEWS2 of 6 or less); (4) SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab; (5) Expected time of hospitalisation {$>$} 48 hours; and (6) Signed informed consent must be obtained and documented according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and national/local regulations. Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) Requiring intensive care unit admission at screening; (2) History of psoriasis; (3) Known adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine sulphate; (4) Pregnancy; or (5) Prolonged corrected QT interval ({$>$}450 ms). Clinical data, including standard hospital biochemistry, medical therapy, vital signs, NEWS2, and microbiology results (including blood culture results and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] for other upper airway viruses), will be automatically extracted from the hospital electronic records and merged with the study specific database. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Included patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to (1) standard care with the addition of 400 mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate (PlaquenilTM) twice daily for seven days or (2) standard care alone. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the rate of decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in oropharyngeal samples as assessed by RT-PCR in samples collected at baseline, 48 and 96 hours after randomization and administration of drug for the intervention arm. Secondary endpoints include change in NEWS2 at 96 hours after randomisation, admission to intensive care unit, mortality (in-hospital, and at 30 and 90 days), duration of hospital admission, clinical status on a 7-point ordinal scale 14 days after randomization ([1] Death [2] Hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [3] Hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices [4] Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen [5] Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen [6] Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities [7] Not hospitalised, with resumption of normal activities), and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide) at 96 hours after randomization. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer randomisation procedure. The allocation sequence has been prepared by an independent statistician. BLINDING (MASKING): Open label randomised controlled pragmatic trial without blinding, no active or placebo control. The virologist assessing viral load in the oropharyngeal samples and the statistician responsible for analysis of the data will be blinded to the treatment allocation for the statistical analyses. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): This is a group sequential adaptive trial where analyses are planned after 51, 101, 151 and 202 completed patients, with a maximum sample size of 202 patients (101 patients allocated to intervention and standard care and 101 patients allocated to standard care alone). TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.3 (March 26, 2020). Recruitment of first patient on March 26, 2020, and 51 patients were included as per April 28, 2020. Study recruitment is anticipated to be completed by July 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04316377. Trial registered March 20, 2020.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In cases of mass-casualty incidents (MCIs), triage represents a fundamental tool for the management of and assistance to the wounded, which helps discriminate not only the priority of attention, but also the priority of referral to the most suitable center. HYPOTHESIS/PROBLEM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of different prehospital triage systems based on physiological parameters (Shock Index [SI], Glasgow-Age-Pressure Score [GAP], Revised Trauma Score [RTS], and National Early Warning Score 2 [NEWS2]) to predict early mortality (within 48 hours) from the index event for use in MCIs. METHODS: This was a longitudinal prospective observational multi-center study on patients who were attended by Advanced Life Support (ALS) units and transferred to the emergency department (ED) of their reference hospital. Collected were: demographic, physiological, and clinical variables; main diagnosis; and data on early mortality. The main outcome variable was mortality from any cause within 48 hours. RESULTS: From April 1, 2018 through February 28, 2019, a total of 1,288 patients were included in this study. Of these, 262 (20.3\%) participants required assistance for trauma and injuries by external agents. Early mortality within the first 48 hours due to any cause affected 69 patients (5.4\%). The system with the best predictive capacity was the NEWS2 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.891 (95\% CI, 0.84-0.94); a sensitivity of 79.7\% (95\% CI, 68.8-87.5); and a specificity of 84.5\% (95\% CI, 82.4-86.4) for a cut-off point of nine points, with a positive likelihood ratio of 5.14 (95\% CI, 4.31-6.14) and a negative predictive value of 98.7\% (95\% CI, 97.8-99.2). CONCLUSION: Prehospital scores of the NEWS2 are easy to obtain and represent a reliable test, which make it an ideal system to help in the initial assessment of high-risk patients, and to determine their level of triage effectively and efficiently. The Prehospital Emergency Medical System (PhEMS) should evaluate the inclusion of the NEWS2 as a triage system, which is especially useful for the second triage (evacuation priority).},

Methods  This is a multicenter longitudinal observational cohort study on patients attending Advanced Life Support units and transferred to the emergency department of their reference hospital. We collected demographic, physiological, and clinical variables, main diagnosis, and hospital triage level as well as mortality. The main outcome variable was mortality from any cause within two days of the index event.  Results  Between April 1 and November 30, 2018, a total of 1054 patients were included in our study. Early mortality within the first 48 hours after the index event affected 55 patients (5.2\%), of which 23 cases (41.8\%) had causes of cardiovascular origin. In the stratification by triage levels, the AUC of the NEWS2 obtained for short-term mortality varied between 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.65-0.89) for level I and 0.94 (95\% CI: 0.79-1) for level III.  Conclusions  The Prehospital Emergency Medical Services should evaluate the implementation of the NEWS2 as a routine evaluation, which, together with the structured hospital triage system, effectively serves to predict early mortality and detect high-risk patients.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective, observational longitudinal study in patients attended by ambulance responders and transferred to the emergency departments of reference hospitals. We collected demographic, physiologic, clinical, and analytical data and the main diagnosis. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: s. A total of 707 patients were included. Thirty-seven patients (5.2\%) died within 48 hours of the index event. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the preNEWS2-L score's prediction of early death was 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.83-0.96). The AUCs for death within 7 and 30 days were 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.79-0.92) and 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.76-0.87), respectively, showing that the score's ability to predict death decreases by almost 10\% between 48 hours and 30 days.

Design               We used two datasets of routinely collected patient data to test and improve on a set of previously proposed discharge criteria.                                         Setting               Bristol Royal Infirmary general intensive care unit (GICU).                                         Patients               Two cohorts derived from historical datasets: 1870 intensive care patients from GICU in Bristol, and 7592 from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III.                                         Results               In both cohorts few successfully discharged patients met all of the discharge criteria. Both a random forest and a logistic classifier, trained using multiple-source cross-validation, demonstrated improved performance over the original criteria and generalised well between the cohorts. The classifiers showed good agreement on which features were most predictive of readiness-for-discharge, and these were generally consistent with clinical experience. By weighting the discharge criteria according to feature importance from the logistic model we showed improved performance over the original criteria, while retaining good interpretability.                                         Conclusions               Our findings indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach to ready-for-discharge classification, which could complement other risk models of specific adverse outcomes in a future decision support system. Avenues for improvement to produce a clinically useful tool are identified.},

The study aimed to quantify the rates of COPD exacerbations in England and assess health care resource utilization by severity categories according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2013. Methods Data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify patients with a COPD diagnosis aged {$\geq$}40 years. Those with complete spirometric, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale information, and exacerbation history 12 months prior to January 1, 2011 (index date) were classified into GOLD severity groups. Study outcomes over follow-up (up to December 31, 2013) were exacerbation rates and resource utilization (general practitioner visits, hospital admissions). Results From the 44,201 patients in the study cohort, 83.5\% were classified into severity levels GOLD A: 33.8\%, GOLD B: 21.0\%, GOLD C: 18.1\%, and GOLD D: 27.0\%. Mean age at diagnosis was 66 years and 52.0\% were male. Annual exacerbation rates per person-year increased with severity, from 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81\textendash 0.85) for GOLD A to 2.51 (95\% CI: 2.47\textendash 2.55) for GOLD D. General practitioner visit rates per person-year also increased with severity, from 4.82 (95\% CI: 4.74\textendash 4.93) for GOLD A to 7.44 (95\% CI: 7.31\textendash 7.61) for GOLD D. COPD-related hospitalization rates per person-year increased from less symptoms (GOLD A: 0.28, GOLD C: 0.39) to more symptoms (GOLD B: 0.52, GOLD D: 0.84). Conclusion Patients in the most severe category (GOLD D) experienced nearly three times the number of exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations as those in the least severe category (GOLD A), in addition to increased general practitioner visits. Better patient management to stabilize the disease progression could allow for an improvement in exacerbation frequency and a reduction in health care resource utilization.},

For symptomatic VTE, these were 10\% (95\% CI, 5.8-16), 21\% (95\% CI, 14-30) and 25\% (95\% CI 16-36). VTE appeared to be associated with death (adjusted HR, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.02-5.5). The cumulative incidence of VTE was higher in the ICU (26\% (95\% CI, 17-37), 47\% (95\% CI, 34-58), and 59\% (95\% CI, 42-72) at 7, 14 and 21 days) than on the wards (any VTE and symptomatic VTE 5.8\% (95\% CI, 1.4-15), 9.2\% (95\% CI, 2.6-21), and 9.2\% (2.6-21) at 7, 14, and 21 days). The observed risk for VTE in COVID-19 is high, particularly in ICU patients, which should lead to a high level of clinical suspicion and low threshold for diagnostic imaging for DVT or PE. Future research should focus on optimal diagnostic and prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE and potentially improve survival.},

  abstract = {Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent chronic pulmonary condition that affects hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Many COPD patients got readmitted to hospital within 30 days after discharge due to various reasons. Such readmission can usually be avoided if additional attention is paid to patients with high readmission risk and appropriate actions are taken. This makes early prediction of the hospital readmission risk an important problem. The goal of this paper is to conduct a systematic study on developing different types of machine learning models, including both deep and non-deep ones, for predicting the readmission risk of COPD patients. We evaluate those different approaches on a real world database containing the medical claims of 111,992 patients from the Geisinger Health System from January 2004 to September 2015. The patient features we build the machine learning models upon include both knowledge-driven ones, which are the features extracted according to clinical knowledge potentially related to COPD readmission, and data-driven features, which are extracted from the patient data themselves. Our analysis showed that the prediction performance in terms of Area Under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) can be improved from around 0.60 using knowledge-driven features, to 0.653 by combining both knowledge-driven and data-driven features, based on the one-year claims history before discharge. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the complex deep learning models in this case cannot really improve the prediction performance, with the best AUC around 0.65.},

We estimated the impact of adding delirium on the number of medium/high level alerts that are triggers to escalate care. Methods Analysis of emergency medical admissions in two acute hospitals (York Hospital (YH) and Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust hospitals (NH)) in England. Twenty per cent were randomly assigned to have delirium. Results The number of emergency admissions (YH: 35584; NH: 35795), mortality (YH: 5.7\%; NH: 5.5\%), index NEWS (YH: 2.5; NH: 2.1) and numbers of NEWS recorded (YH: 879193; NH: 884072) were similar in each hospital. The mean number of patients with medium level alerts per day increased from 55.3 (NEWS) to 69.5 (NEWS2), a 25.7\% increase in YH and 64.1 (NEWS) to 77.4 (NEWS2), a 20.7\% increase in NH. The mean number of patients with high level alerts per day increased from 27.3 (NEWS) to 34.4 (NEWS2), a 26.0\% increase in YH and 29.9 (NEWS) to 37.7 (NEWS2), a 26.1\% increase in NH. Conclusions The addition of delirium in NEWS2 will have a substantial increase in medium and high level alerts in hospitalised emergency medical patients. Rigorous evaluation of NEWS2 is required before widespread implementation because the extent to which staff can cope with this increase without adverse consequences remains unknown.},

  abstract = {Background There is a need for validated clinical risk scores to identify patients at risk of severe disease and to guide decision-making during the covid-19 pandemic. The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is widely used in emergency medicine, but so far, no studies have evaluated its use in patients with covid-19. We aimed to study the performance of NEWS2 and compare commonly used clinical risk strati cation tools at admission to predict risk of severe disease and in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. Methods This was a prospective cohort study in a public non-university general hospital in the Oslo area, Norway, including a cohort of all 66 patients hospitalised with con rmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the start of the pandemic; 13 who died during hospital stay and 53 who were discharged alive. Data were collected consecutively from March 9th to April 27th 2020. The main outcome was the ability of the NEWS2 score and other clinical risk scores at emergency department admission to predict severe disease and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients. We calculated sensitivity and speci city with 95\% con dence intervals (CIs) for NEWS2 scores {$\geq$}5 and {$\geq$}6, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score {$\geq$}2, {$\geq$}2 Systemic In ammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and CRB-65 score {$\geq$}2. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for the clinical risk scores were compared using DeLong's test. Results In total, 66 patients (mean age 67.9 years) were included. Of these, 23\% developed severe disease. In-hospital mortality was 20\%. Tachypnoea, hypoxemia and confusion at admission were more common in patients developing severe disease. A NEWS2 score {$\geq$}6 at admission predicted severe disease with 80.0\% sensitivity and 84.3\% speci city (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.822, 95\% con dence interval (CI) 0.690-0.953). NEWS2 was superior to qSOFA score {$\geq$}2 (AUC 0.624, 95\% CI 0.446-0.810, p{$<$}0.05) and other clinical risk scores for this purpose. Conclusion NEWS2 score at hospital admission predicted severe disease and in-hospital mortality, and was superior to other widely used clinical risk scores in patients with covid-19.},

On ICU admission, prothrombin time was slightly reduced and it increased significantly at T10 (T0\,=\,65.1\,{$\pm$}\,9.8 vs T10\,=\,85.7\,{$\pm$}\,1.5, p\,=\,0.002), while activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen values were higher at T0 than T10 (32.2\,{$\pm$}\,2.9 vs 27.2\,{$\pm$}\,2.1, p\,=\,0.017 and 895.1\,{$\pm$}\,110 vs 332.5\,{$\pm$}\,50, p\,=\,0.002, respectively); moreover, whole blood thromboelastometry profiles were consistent with hypercoagulability characterized by an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation [i.e., CFT below the lower limit in INTEM 16/40 patients (40\%) and EXTEM 20/40 patients (50\%)] and significant higher clot strength [MCF above the upper limit in INTEM 20/40 patients (50\%), in EXTEM 28/40 patients (70\%) and in FIBTEM 29/40 patients (72.5\%)]; however, this hypercoagulable state persists in the first five days, but it decreases ten day after, without returning to normal values. No sign of secondary hyperfibrinolysis or sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) were found during the study period. In six patients (15\%) a deep vein thrombosis and in 2 patients (5\%) a thromboembolic event, were found; 12 patients (30\%) had a catheter-related~thrombosis. ROTEM analysis confirms that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had a hypercoagulation state that persisted over time.},

To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44\%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention. The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.},

An investigation was conducted in order to establish whether combinations of VOCs could identify COPD patients from age and BMI matched controls. Breath samples were collected from 119 stable COPD patients and 63 healthy controls. The samples were collected with a portable apparatus, and then assayed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Machine learning approaches were applied to the data and the automatically generated models were assessed using classification accuracy and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Cross-validation of the combinations correctly predicted the diagnosis in 79\% of COPD patients and 64\% of controls and an optimum area under the ROC curve of 0.82 was obtained. Comparison of current and ex smokers within the COPD group showed that smoking status was likely to affect the classification; with correct prediction of smoking status in 85\% of COPD subjects. When current smokers were omitted from the analysis, prediction of COPD was similar at 78\% but correct prediction of controls was increased to 74\%. Applying different analytical methods to the largest group of subjects so far, suggests VOC analysis holds promise for diagnosing COPD but smoking status needs to be balanced.},

  abstract = {Aims To compare the ability of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to identify patients at risk of in-hospital mortality and other adverse outcomes. Methods We undertook a multi-centre retrospective observational study at five acute hospitals from two UK NHS Trusts. Data were obtained from completed adult admissions who were not fit enough to be discharged alive on the day of admission. Diagnostic coding and oxygen prescriptions were used to identify patients with type II respiratory failure (T2RF). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 24\,h of a vital signs observation. Secondary outcomes included unanticipated intensive care unit admission or cardiac arrest within 24\,h of a vital signs observation. Discrimination was assessed using the c-statistic. Results Among 251,266 adult admissions, 48,898 were identified to be at risk of T2RF by diagnostic coding. In this group, NEWS2 showed statistically significant lower discrimination (c-statistic, 95\% CI) for identifying in-hospital mortality within 24\,h (0.860, 0.857\textendash 0.864) than NEWS (0.881, 0.878-0.884). For 1394 admissions with documented T2RF, discrimination was similar for both systems: NEWS2 (0.841, 0.827-0.855), NEWS (0.862, 0.848\textendash 0.875). For all secondary endpoints, NEWS2 showed no improvements in discrimination. Conclusions NEWS2 modifications to NEWS do not improve discrimination of adverse outcomes in patients with documented T2RF and decrease discrimination in patients at risk of T2RF. Further evaluation of the relationship between SpO2 values, oxygen therapy and risk should be investigated further before wide-scale adoption of NEWS2.},

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Central Database. The outcomes of interest were: a composite of poor outcome mortality, severe COVID-19, the need for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) and disease progression. RESULTS: Data on 4603 patients were pooled from 21 studies. COPD was associated with an increased risk for composite poor outcome (OR 5.01, 95\% CI 3.06\textendash 8.22; P {$<$} 0.001; I2 0\%); mortality (OR 4.36, 95\% CI 1.45\textendash 13.10; P = 0.009; I2 0\%); severe COVID-19 (OR 4.62, 95\% CI 2.49\textendash 8.56; P {$<$} 0.001; I2 0\%); ICU care (OR 8.33, 95\% CI 1.27\textendash 54.56; P = 0.03; I2 0\%); and disease progression (OR 8.42, 95\% CI 1.60\textendash 44.27; P = 0.01; I2 0\%). Smoking was found to increase the risk of composite poor outcome (OR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.16\textendash 2.00; P = 0.005; I2 12\%), and subgroup analysis showed that smoking was significant for increased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 1.65, 95\% CI 1.17\textendash 2.34; P = 0.004; I2 11\%). Current smokers were at a higher risk of composite poor outcome (OR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.10\textendash 2.27; P = 0.01; I2 0\%) than former or non-smokers. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that COPD and smoking were associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.},

The need for an early and confirmed diagnosis of COPD is increasingly appreciated by primary care physicians in whose hands the ability to make improvements in early diagnosis largely rests. Case-finding of patients with symptoms of lifestyle limitation is probably the most practical way to achieve early diagnosis. Evidence suggests a burden of early COPD on afflicted people and their families. Early encouragement of smoking cessation, in conjunction with management of symptoms and treating activity limitation and exacerbations by appropriate non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management at the earliest possible stage, could positively affect the impact and progression of the disease.},

The purpose of this review is to summarize the influence of gender on various attributes of this disease, which will help physicians provide more personalized care to COPD patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Cultural trends in smoking have morphed the epidemiology of this traditionally male disease. There is an increasing 'disease burden' among women with COPD as suggested by the higher prevalence and slower decline in death rates as compared with men. Biologic differences between the genders account for some, but not all of these differences. In women, distinct features need to be considered to boost success of therapeutic interventions such as smoking cessation, addressing comorbidities, and attendance to pulmonary rehabilitation. SUMMARY: COPD in women is distinct from that in men with respect to phenotype, symptom burden, and comorbidities. Women are more predisposed to develop chronic bronchitis, have more dyspnea, and suffer more frequently from coexistent anxiety or depression. They may be more subject than men to misdiagnoses and/or underdiagnoses of COPD, often as a result of physician bias. Knowledge of these gender differences can lead to more effective tailored care of the COPD patient.},

  abstract = {Background Few observations exist with respect to the pro-coagulant profile of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem. Objectives Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis. Methods Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. Results At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95\% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 {$\mu$}g/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933). Fibrinogen levels were associated (R2 = .506, P = .003) with interleukin-6 values. After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P = .001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P = .017), CS (P = .013), PCS (P = .035), and FCS (P = .038). Conclusion The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease. Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.},

This is especially true in the use case of mechanical ventilation (MV), where current CDSS have no knowledge of critical ventilation settings, such as ventilation mode. To enable MV CDSS to make accurate recommendations related to ventilator mode, we developed a highly performant ma-chine learning model that is able to perform per-breath clas-sification of 5 of the most widely used ventilation modes in the USA with an average F1-score of 97.52\%.

  abstract = {Medicine and especially chronic diseases, like everything else on earth is filled with ambiguity. This is why, identifying patients at risk present a big challenge to human brain. Poor control and misdiagnosis of chronic diseases has a great impact quality of life of patients, the expenses and performance of health care system. The global economic cost of chronic diseases could reach \$47 trillion by 2030, according to a study by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Beside this economic burden, such treatment failure increases the risk of progression of disease which inevitably leads to premature death or further illness and suffering. Today, health informatics is reshaping the research in the medical domain due to its potential to concurrently overcome the challenges encountered in the traditional healthcare systems. Uncertainty, accuracy, causal attributes and their relationship, all have their places in this new technology through contemporary machine learning algorithms. Prediction of exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is considered one of the most difficult problems in the medical field. In this paper, we will leverage unused machine learning methods to increase prediction accuracy in COPD. To this end, we compared three of the most common machine learning algorithms (decision tree, naive Bayes and Bayesian network) based on ROC metric. Furthermore, we used discretization process for the first time in this context.},

However, there is reluctance from GPs to adopt NEWS/NEWS2. Aim To assess whether NEWS calculated at the point of GP referral into hospital is associated with outcomes in secondary care. Design and setting An observational study using routinely collected data from primary and secondary care. Method NEWS values were prospectively collected for 13 047 GP referrals into acute care between July 2017 and December 2018. NEWS values were examined and multivariate linear and logistic regression used to assess associations with process measures and clinical outcomes. Results Higher NEWS values were associated with faster conveyance for patients travelling by ambulance, for example, median 94 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 69\textendash 139) for NEWS {$\geq$}7; median 132 minutes, (IQR 84\textendash 236) for NEWS = 0 to 2); faster time from hospital arrival to medical review (54 minutes [IQR 25\textendash 114] for NEWS {$\geq$}7; 78 minutes [IQR 34\textendash 158] for NEWS = 0 to 2); as well as increased length of stay (5 days [IQR 2\textendash 11] versus 1 day [IQR 0\textendash 5]); intensive care unit admissions (2.0\% versus 0.5\%); sepsis diagnosis (11.7\% versus 2.5\%); and mortality, for example, 30-day mortality 12.0\% versus 4.1\% for NEWS {$\geq$}7 versus NEWS = 0 to 2, respectively. On average, for patients referred without a NEWS value (NEWS = NR), most clinical outcomes were comparable with patients with NEWS = 3 to 4, but ambulance conveyance time and time to medical review were comparable with patients with NEWS = 0 to 2. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that higher NEWS values calculated at GP referral into hospital are associated with a faster medical review and poorer clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitute a substantial burden to healthcare services. Analysis of national healthcare datasets offers the possibility to advance understanding about the changing epidemiology of COPD. Aim To investigate the epidemiology of physician-diagnosed COPD in general practice. Design of study Cross-sectional study. Settings A total of 422 general practices in England contributing to the QRESEARCH database. Method Data were extracted on 2.8 million patients, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, and geographical area. Trends over time for recorded physician diagnosis of COPD were analysed (2001\textendash 2005). Results There was little change over time in the incidence rate of COPD (2005: 2.0 per 1000 patient-years, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 2.1), but a significant increase in lifetime prevalence rate (2001: 13.5 per 1000 patients [95\% CI = 13.4 to 13.7]; 2005: 16.8 [95\% CI = 16.7 to 17.0]; P{$<$}0.001). In 2005, 51 804 individuals or one in 59 people in England were recorded with physician-diagnosed COPD. The most deprived people (31.1 per 1000 patients; 95\% CI = 30.6 to 31.7) and those living in the north east of England (29.2 per 1000 patients; 95\% CI = 28.4 to 30.1) had the highest prevalence. The observed reduction in the rate of smoking by patients with COPD (overall decrease: 2.5\%; P{$<$}0.001) varied according to socioeconomic group (most affluent: 6.5\% decrease, most deprived: 1.3\% decrease). Conclusion Given the peak in the incidence rate of COPD, we may be approaching the summit of COPD incidence and prevalence in England. However, the number of people affected remains high and poses a major challenge for health services, particularly those in the north east of the country and in the most deprived communities in England. The very limited decrease in smoking rates among the more deprived groups of patients with COPD is also a cause for concern.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Objectives:To investigate whether patterns of National Early Warning Scores (NEWS/NEWS2) in care homes during the COVID pandemic correspond with area-level COVID-19 death registrations from care homes. Study design: Longitudinal ecological study. Setting: 460 Care home units using the same software package to collect data on residents, from 46 local authority areas in England. Participants: 6,464 care home residents with at least one NEWS recording. Exposure measure: 29,656 anonymised person-level NEWS from 29/12/2019 to 20/05/2020 with component physiological measures: systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Baseline values for each measure calculated using 80th and 20th centile scores before March 2020. Outcome measure: Time series comparison with Office for National Statistics (ONS) weekly reported registered deaths of care home residents where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, and all other deaths (excluding COVID-19) up to 10/05/2020. Results: Deaths due to COVID-19 were registered from 23/03/2020 in the study geographical areas. Between 23/03/2020 and 10/05/2020, there were 5,753 deaths (1,532 involving COVID-19 and 4,221 other causes). The proportion of above-baseline NEWS increased from 16/03/2020 and closely followed the rise and fall in COVID-19 deaths over the study period. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately two weeks before peaks in care home deaths in corresponding geographical areas. Conclusions: NEWS may make a useful contribution to disease surveillance in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents9 health. Further work using individual level outcome data is needed to evaluate the role of NEWS in the early detection of resident illness.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this paper, we provide a framework that partitions sources of downstream harm in machine learning into six distinct categories spanning the data generation and machine learning pipeline. We describe how these issues arise, how they are relevant to particular applications, and how they motivate different solutions. In doing so, we aim to facilitate the development of solutions that stem from an understanding of application-specific populations and data generation processes, rather than relying on general statements about what may or may not be "fair."},

The accuracy of the model is assessed against a panel of physicians each triaging identical cases in a representative patient validation set. Our results show that algorithm accuracy and safety indicators surpass all individual pulmonologists in both identifying exacerbations and predicting the consensus triage in a 101 case validation set.

  abstract = {Hemorrhage continues to be one of the leading causes of death following trauma. Trauma patients are susceptible to the early development of coagulopathy and the most severely injured patients are coagulopathic on hospital admission. Hypothermia, acidosis, and dilution from standard resuscitation can worsen the presenting coagulopathy and perpetuate bleeding. Early identification of coagulopathy is dependent on clinical awareness and point of care laboratory values. Routinely used laboratory coagulation parameters fail to adequately describe this state. Thrombelastography is a test that can be done at the bedside and uses whole blood to provide a functional evaluation of coagulation. Rapid diagnosis of coagulopathy, followed by prevention or correction of hypothermia and acidosis should be a priority during the initial evaluation and resuscitation. Judicious use of resuscitation fluids and early replacement of coagulation factors will help prevent iatrogenic hemodilution. This review covers the pathophysiology as well as the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of coagulopathy. Prevention and treatment strategies are discussed, including early transfusion of coagulation factors during massive transfusion and the use of recombinant factor VIIa. Damage control resuscitation is briefly discussed, and it involves the combination of hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic resuscitation. Finally, a description of the use of fresh whole blood in the military setting is included. Its use has been proven to be safe and beneficial in this setting and warrants further investigation as an adjunct to the management of civilian trauma patients.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become the deadliest pandemic in modern history, reaching nearly every country worldwide and overwhelming healthcare institutions. As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To cluster 13 clinically important objectively identified comorbidities, and to characterize the comorbidity clusters in terms of clinical outcomes and systemic inflammation. Methods: A total of 213 patients with COPD (FEV1, 51 6 17\% predicted; men, 59\%; age, 64 6 7 yr) were included prospectively. Comorbidities were based on well-known cut-offs identified in the peer-reviewed English literature. Systemic inflammatory biomarkers were determined in all patients. Self-organizing maps were used to generate comorbidity clusters. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 97.7\% of all patients had one or more comorbidities and 53.5\% had four or more comorbidities. Five comorbidity clusters were identified: (1) less comorbidity, (2) cardiovascular, (3) cachectic, (4) metabolic, and (5) psychological. Comorbidity clusters differed in health status but were comparable with respect to disease severity. An increased inflammatory state was observed only for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors in the metabolic cluster (geometric mean [lower and upper limit]; TNF-R1, 2,377 [1,850, 3,055] pg/ml, confidence, 98.5\%; TNF-R2, 4,080 [3,115, 5,344] pg/ml, confidence, 98.8\%) and only for IL-6 in the cardiovascular cluster (IL-6, 3.4 [1.8, 6.6] pg/ml; confidence, 99.8\%). Conclusions: Multimorbidity is common in patients with COPD, and different comorbidity clusters can be identified. Low-grade systemic inflammation is mostly comparable among comorbidity clusters. Increasing knowledge on the interactions between comorbidities increases the understanding of their development and contributes to strategies for prevention or improved treatment.},

The aim was to explore whether the presence of common comorbidities increases COVID-19 patients' risk. A literature search was performed using the electronic platforms (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases) to obtain relevant research studies published up to March 1, 2020. Relevant data of research endpoints in each study were extracted and merged. All data analysis was performed using Stata12.0 software. A total of 1558 patients with COVID-19 in 6 studies were enrolled in our meta-analysis eventually. Hypertension (OR: 2.29, P{$<$}0.001), diabetes (OR: 2.47, P{$<$}0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR: 5.97, P{$<$}0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.93, P{$<$}0.001), and cerebrovascular disease (OR:3.89, P=0.002)were independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis revealed no correlation between increased risk of COVID-19 and liver disease, malignancy, or renal disease. Hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of these risk factors can be a resource for clinicians in the early appropriate medical management of patients with COVID-19.},

A unique feature of COVID-19 respiratory failure is a relatively preserved lung compliance and high Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, with pathology reports consistently demonstrating diffuse pulmonary microthrombi on autopsy, all consistent with a vascular occlusive etiology of respiratory failure rather than the more classic findings of low-compliance in ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming the world's medical care capacity with unprecedented needs for mechanical ventilators and high rates of mortality once patients progress to needing mechanical ventilation, and in many environments including in parts of the United States the medical capacity is being exhausted. Fibrinolytic therapy has previously been used in a Phase 1 clinical trial that led to reduced mortality and marked improvements in oxygenation. Here we report a series of three patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure who were treated with tissue plasminogen activator. All three patients had a temporally related improvement in their respiratory status, with one of them being a durable response.},

  abstract = {Rationale To assess the treatment progression during the 24 months following a formal diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the UK primary care setting. Methods A retrospective cohort of newly diagnosed COPD patients was identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1/1/2008 until 31/12/2009. Maintenance therapy prescribed within the first 3 months of diagnosis and in the subsequent 3-month intervals for 24 months were analyzed. Treatment classes included long-acting {$\beta$}2-agonists (LABAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and respective combinations. At each 3-month interval, discontinuation, switching, addition, and stepping down patterns were analyzed cumulatively for the first 12 months and over the 24-month of follow-up. Results A total of 3199 patients with at least one prescription of a maintenance therapy at baseline and during 4th-6th month interval were included in the analysis. At diagnosis (0\textendash 3 months), the most frequently prescribed maintenance therapy was LABA+ICS (43\%), followed by LAMA (24\%) and LABA+LAMA+ICS (23\%). Nearly half the patients (LABA-50\%, LAMA-43\%) starting on a monobronchodilator had additions to their treatment in 24 months. Compared to other medications, patients starting on a LAMA were most likely to escalate to triple therapy in 24 months. Nearly one-fourth of the patients prescribed triple therapy at baseline stepped down to LABA+ICS (25\%) or LAMA (31\%) within 24 months. Conclusion Disease progression is evident over the 24 months after COPD diagnosis, as more patients were prescribed additional maintenance therapy in the 24-month period compared to baseline. The changes in therapy suggest that it is difficult to achieve a consistently improved COPD disease state.},

  abstract = {Objective To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease. Design Living systematic review and critical appraisal. Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). Results 4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included. The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine. The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting. Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones. The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

  abstract = {Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy, the difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2 has not been analyzed. Coagulation results and clinical features of consecutive patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 (COVID group) and non-SARS-CoV2 (non-COVID group) in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed and compared. Whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated. There were 449 COVID patients and 104 non-COVID patients enrolled into the study. The 28-day mortality in COVID group was approximately twofold of mortality in non-COVID group (29.8\% vs. 15.4\%, P\,=\,0.003), COVID group were older (65.1\,{$\pm$}\,12.0 vs. 58.4\,{$\pm$}\,18.0, years, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and with higher platelet count (215\,{$\pm$}\,100 vs. 188\,{$\pm$}\,98, \texttimes 109/L, P\,=\,0.015), comparing to non-COVID group. The 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In COVID group with D-dimer\,{$>$}\,3.0 {$\mu$}g/mL (32.8\% vs. 52.4\%, P\,=\,0.017). Patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-SARS-CoV2, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant treatment.},

  abstract = {The major challenge in the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) comes from the lack of specific biomarkers, leading to developing composite scoring systems. DIC scores are simple and rapidly applicable. However, optimal fibrin-related markers and their cut-off values remain to be defined, requiring optimization for use. The aim of this study is to optimize the use of DIC-related parameters through machine learning (ML)-approach. Further, we evaluated whether this approach could provide a diagnostic value in DIC diagnosis. For this, 46 DIC-related parameters were investigated for both clinical findings and laboratory results. We retrospectively reviewed 656 DIC-suspected cases at an initial order for full DIC profile and labeled their evaluation results (Set 1; DIC, n = 228; non-DIC, n = 428). Several ML algorithms were tested, and an artificial neural network (ANN) model was established via independent training and testing using 32 selected parameters. This model was externally validated from a different hospital with 217 DIC-suspected cases (Set 2; DIC, n = 80; non-DIC, n = 137). The ANN model represented higher AUC values than the three scoring systems in both set 1 (ANN 0.981; ISTH 0.945; JMHW 0.943; and JAAM 0.928) and set 2 (AUC ANN 0.968; ISTH 0.946). Additionally, the relative importance of the 32 parameters was evaluated. Most parameters had contextual importance, however, their importance in ML-approach was different from the traditional scoring system. Our study demonstrates that ML could optimize the use of clinical parameters with robustness for DIC diagnosis. We believe that this approach could play a supportive role in physicians' medical decision by integrated into electrical health record system. Further prospective validation is required to assess the clinical consequence of ML-approach and their clinical benefit.},

There are currently no universally accepted methods for assessing discharge of patients from an ICU, which can cause premature discharges and put patients at risk of subsequent deterioration, readmission to ICU or death.},

  abstract = {Comorbidities are associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This meta-analysis aimed to explore the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing smoking history. A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The languages of literature included English and Chinese. The point prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing COPD and those with ongoing smoking was evaluated with this meta-analysis. Overall 11 case series, published either in Chinese or English language with a total of 2002 cases, were included in this study. The pooled OR of COPD and the development of severe COVID-19 was 4.38 (fixed-effects model; 95\% CI: 2.34-8.20), while the OR of ongoing smoking was 1.98 (fixed-effects model; 95\% CI: 1.29-3.05). There was no publication bias as examined by the funnel plot and Egger's test (P = not significant). The heterogeneity of included studies was moderate for both COPD and ongoing smoking history on the severity of COVID-19. COPD and ongoing smoking history attribute to the worse progression and outcome of COVID-19.},
