# Responsible Research Practices Self-Assessment

[![Read the book](https://img.shields.io/badge/read-the%20book-blue.svg)](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rrp-selfassessment/)

This is an interactive guide for the self-assessment of bias and the transparent reporting of a predictive model study.

The purpose of this guide is two-fold:

- To provide project teams with a means for reflecting upon the steps taken within the team to mitigate the effects of social, statistical, and cognitive biases throughout the project lifecycle, and
- To report and communicate these methods in a systematic, transparent, and accessible manner.

The guide is split into two sections that address the above goals: a [bias self-assessment](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rrp-selfassessment/bias/bias-intro.html) and a [transparent reporting reflect-list](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rrp-selfassessment/transparent-reporting/transparent-reporting.html). These two sections are interconnected through reference to a common project workflow.

The guide has been developed using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/). The benefit of this format is that it supports the integration of interactive elements that are designed to facilitate discussion within and between the teams.

The guide is designed to be a living document, but is still a work-in-progress in terms of creating a stable foundation. We have plans to improve and revise it, in order to broaden the scope beyond data science in healthcare. Therefore, if you want to contribute or have any feedback, we would encourage you to get in touch: cburr@turing.ac.uk
